- Install Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS (64-BIT) on an SD card with the Raspberry Pi Imager software.
 - Raspberry Pi OS is incompatible with llamafile, unless you are using a Raspberry Pi 5.

On the Raspberry Pi:

- sudo apt update
- sudo apt install ffmpeg
- sudo apt install espeak
- sudo apt install python3-pip
- sudo apt install python3-pyaudio
- pip3 install openai openai-whisper RPi.GPIO pyaudio

- git clone https://github.com/nickbild/local_llm_assistant
- cd local_llm_assistant
- wget https://huggingface.co/jartine/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-GGUF/resolve/main/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0.Q5_K_M.llamafile?download=true
- mv TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0.Q5_K_M.llamafile?download=true TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0.Q5_K_M.llamafile
- chmod 755 TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0.Q5_K_M.llamafile

- Plug a speaker into the headphone jack
- Plug in a USB microphone
- Push button pins ...

- ./TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0.Q5_K_M.llamafile
In a different window:
- python3 chatbot.py

Wait a few seconds until you see the "Ready..." message, then press the button. When you see the "recording" message, speak your request. After the LLM completes its work, the response will be spoken through the speaker.

NOTE: The first time that you run this script, the speech-to-text model will need to be downloaded, so have patience. It will be cached locally for future runs.
